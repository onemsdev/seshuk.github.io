Its the beginning of a new year. Time for planning, thinking through and putting together stuff that needs to be done so that I keep improving myself. I kind of do this year but I tend to loose track after few months. _This year however_, I want to try publishing the plan and take additional efforts so that it could drive me in completing what I planned at the beginning.
