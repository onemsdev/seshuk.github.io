It’s the beginning of a new year. Time for planning, thinking through and putting together stuff that needs to be done so that I keep improving myself. I kind of do this every year, but I tend to lose track after few months. _This year however_, I want to try publishing the plan and take additional efforts so that it could drive me in completing what I planned at the beginning.

***Here goes the list:***

**Health:**
In general, be more active than past year. I started using ***[Gyroscope app](https://gyrosco.pe/)*** from last quarter of 2017 to track most of my life activities. The same shall be used to track this year as well.  

Stats from last year:

![2017_Activity_Rep.png]({{site.baseurl}}/img/2017_Activity_Rep.png)

 - *8k or more steps:* Track 8k steps every day of the year on an average.  Past years average was 9.7k per day. *Update: - The sesamoid bone injury is making it hard to achieve 10k goal. And I don't know how long it would take to heal. To be realistic I'm reducing to 8k steps.*
 - *2018 KMs cycle/running:* This one could be tough. But will force me to ride more often. This target would be _almost 3x times_ from the past year.
 - *Yoga at least 2 times a week:* Make it at least 100 yoga sessions this year which is, 4x times more than last year. 

 

**Craft:** 
* _Write blogs posts regularly_ - At least *25 posts:* This has been something I started and stopped last two years. I want to break that and make blogging a habit.
  - Blog on anything I learned from below activities or status/progress of activities mentioned in this post every quarter.

* _Side projects:_
  - *At least 2* in Mobile/Azure/Machine Learning/AI/IoT. This should keep the learning on going.

* Complete at least *2 technical certifications* to prove/validate learning.

**Reading:**
Read at least 4-5 books this year. I know this is small target, but reading is not limited to just books. However, reading tech books is almost over due to how fast tech is changing these days. Hence just limiting to following categories:
  - 2 Self help
  - 1 Personal finance
  - 1 Sci-Fi/thriller

**Personal:**
* Tick off at least 1 item in personal bucket list
 - Post once done.

_I'm excited to start this year than ever....._

# Happy New Year - 2018 #

_P. S_: An interesting video on choosing to change life then just one year. I'd say let’s start with this year and improve every year.
