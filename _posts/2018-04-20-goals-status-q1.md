Wow. Time files. The first quarter is gone already. Here is the small status of how I'm doing with the goals:


## Stats for Q1:


### Health:

There have been some developments in my health after the new year resolution. My sesamoid bone injury has not got any better than I anticipated and as result, I had to reduce the total step goal to more realistic 8k steps per day.

 - ***Goal 1:*** *8k or more steps:* On track for this goal. In fact more than expected. :+1: :+1:

 - ***Goal 2:*** *2018 KMs :bicyclist: / :runner: :* It went really well in Jan to some extent in Feb, however, its dropped quite low in March and April was worst. Time to make amends and I have a plan in place. I've set up an indoor trainer and hopefully, I should be able to do better in next quarter.

- ***Goal 3:*** *Yoga at least 2 times a week:* I'm terribly behind on this :snail: . So far only 4 sessions done. This something that needs to be picked up seriously. 

 

### Craft: 


- ***Goal 1:*** _Write blogs posts regularly_ 
-- At least *25 posts:* To achieve this I should have come up with at least 2 a month. I have done only 1 a month. I have the ideas that need to be written up. Hopefully will pick up this quarter.

- ***Goal 2:*** _Side projects:_
  -- *At least 2* in Mobile/Azure/Machine Learning/AI/IoT. This should keep the learning ongoing. - No progress! :smirk:

- ***Goal 3:*** _Complete at least *2 technical certifications_ to prove/validate learning: Study in progress.

### Reading:


- ***Goal 1:*** _Read (listen) at least 4-5 books this year:_

  - 2 Self-help - Finished "The Power of Habit" and trying to make some tweaks to habits that will help me achieve the goals. [Read my review](/2018-04-15-power-of-habits/).
  - 1 Personal finance - No progress.
  - 1 Sci-Fi/thriller - No progress. The book I'm planning to is The Mahabharata Secret.

### Personal:

- *Tick off at least 1 item in personal bucket list:*
 Happy to say, I've made great progress in this category. Somethings I might not share on this platform, but 2 items on the list very much ticked off.

_I'm hoping that I'll get back on track on items lagging......_
